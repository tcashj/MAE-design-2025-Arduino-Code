void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:

}

Collaborators can view? check

arduino to github? Check

Next step is to find out branchs?

          pull request are for others to review/ see what changes you made to the code before adding it to the main branch


Conflict resolution?

Steps to set up
    1. download github desktop and arduino ide
    2. open github website and then click code (shoulde be a green button around the mid top right ish area)
    3. click open with get hub dekstop (this clones the code from website to the app)
          * should take a little bit to load
    4. open github desktop if it doesnt open automatically
    5. i use the "view files in your repository" option since the first option options up a blank project and 
       then i would have to open the saved project everytime
    6. then we will edit a specific branch of code then when we are done we save the code, then go back to githut desktop and commit it 
          * branches are named gizmo, wheels, ect
    7. after the coder commits their new code the owner or someone will look at the code and if it looks ok then they can press 

  
void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
