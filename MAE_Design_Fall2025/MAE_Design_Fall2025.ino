Collaborators can view? check

arduino to github? Check

The next step is to find out the branches.
          Pull requests are for others to review/see what changes you made to the code before adding it to the main branch


Conflict resolution? check

Steps to set up
    1. Download github desktop and arduino ide
    2. open github website and then click code (shoulde be a green button around the mid top right ish area)
    3. click open with get hub dekstop (this clones the code from website to the app)
          * should take a little bit to load
    4. open github desktop if it doesnt open automatically
    5. i use the "view files in your repository" option since the first option options up a blank project and 
       then i would have to open the saved project everytime
    6. then we will edit a specific branch of code then when we are done we save the code, then go back to githut desktop and commit it 
          * branches are named gizmo, wheels, ect
    7. after the coder commits their new code the owner or someone will look at the code and if it looks ok then they can press 

  
    1. Download the tools
          Install GitHub Desktop.
          Install Arduino IDE.
    2. Get the repository
          Go to our project on the GitHub website.
          Click the green Code button (top-right area).
          Choose Open with GitHub Desktop.
          This will clone (copy) the repo (repository) onto your computer.
    3. Open GitHub Desktop
          It will take a little bit, but if it doesn’t open automatically, launch it yourself.
          Choose “View files in your repository” to quickly open the folder where your Arduino project lives.
    4. Open the project in Arduino IDE
          Double-click to open the file.
              Make sure you’re working in this repo folder (so GitHub can track changes).
    5. Work on a branch
          In GitHub Desktop, make or switch to a branch (e.g., gizmo, wheels, sensors).
          Code and save changes in Arduino IDE.
    6. Commit changes
          Go back to GitHub Desktop.
          You’ll see your changes under the Changes tab.
          Write a short description of what you did (e.g., “Added motor speed control”).
          Click Commit to [branch name].
    7. Sync your work
          Press Push origin (top bar) to upload your branch changes to GitHub online.
          Press Create Pull requests 
    8. Review and merge
          On the GitHub website, open a Pull Request for your branch.
          Teammates review the code.
          If it’s good, press Merge Pull Request to add it to main.
