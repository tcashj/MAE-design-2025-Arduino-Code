The next step is to find out the branches.
          Pull requests are for others to review/see what changes you made to the code before adding it to the main branch

Steps to set up
    1. Download the tools
          Install GitHub Desktop.
          Install Arduino IDE.
    2. Get the repository
          Go to our project on the GitHub website.
          Click the green Code button (top-right area).
          Choose Open with GitHub Desktop.
          This will clone (copy) the repo (repository) onto your computer.
    3. Open GitHub Desktop
          It will take a little bit, but if it doesn’t open automatically, launch it yourself.
          Choose “View files in your repository” to quickly open the folder where your Arduino project lives.
    4. Open the project in Arduino IDE
          Double-click to open the file.
              Make sure you’re working in this repo folder (so GitHub can track changes).
    5. Work on a branch
          In GitHub Desktop, make or switch to a branch (e.g., gizmo, wheels, sensors).
          Code and save changes in Arduino IDE.
    6. Commit changes
          Go back to GitHub Desktop.
          You’ll see your changes under the Changes tab.
          Write a short description of what you did (e.g., “Added motor speed control”).
          Click Commit to [branch name].
    7. Sync your work
          Press Push origin (top bar) to upload your branch changes to GitHub online.
          Press Create Pull requests, and it will take you to the website
    8. Review and merge
          On the GitHub website, open a Pull Request for your branch.
          Teammates review the code.
          If it’s good, press Merge Pull Request to add it to main.
