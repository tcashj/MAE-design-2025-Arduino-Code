void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:

}

Collaborators can view? check

arduino to github? Check

The next step is to find out the branches.
          Pull requests are for others to review/see what changes you made to the code before adding it to the main branch

Steps to set up
    1. download github desktop and arduino ide
    2. Open github website and then click Code (should be a green button around the mid top right-ish area)
    3. Click open with GitHub Desktop (this clones the code from the website to the app)
          * should take a little bit to load
    4. Open GitHub Desktop if it doesn't open automatically
    5. I use the "view files in your repository" option since the first option options up a blank project and 
       Then I would have to open the saved project every time
    6. Then we will edit a specific branch of code, then when we are done, we save the code, then go back to GitHub desktop and commit it 
          * branches are named gizmo, wheels, etc
    7. After the coder commits their new code, the owner or someone will look at the code, and if it looks ok, then they can press 

  
void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
